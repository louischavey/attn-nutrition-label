<h1>Building Tools with Thoughtful friction to create care.</h1>
<p>The above defining principle of my practice has three major influences: My understanding of the attention economy; frameworks of attention; and intentional usage of my technology's materiality. </p>
<p>My understanding of the attention economy is largely shaped by Chris Hayes' book *Siren's Call*, where our lived, modern experience is rooted in the commodification of our attention. From a larger perspective, the core phenomenon at the center of all this is the individualization of experience. As algorithms further hyper-personalize content and the sequencing of that content, we are more and more isolated from the shared experience that media used to be, whether it's scrolling TikTok alone versus gathering to watch a live broadcast on a single TV; blasting Spotify in noise-cancelling headphones versus attending a concert; or quiet, inward-focused white-cube art galleries nowadays versus socializing in a crowded *salon* while viewing artwork from ceiling to ceiling. The more individualized the media consumption experience is, ads become more and more effective. As Helen Nissenbaum puts it in her Rhizome 7x7 panel, we become more readable to machines as our algorithms and experience with the content they serve amplify one another repeatedly. To reclaim our humanity, we must reframe attention as not an extractable resource that is “wasted” if it’s not filled with data-producing entertainment or work but as a nourishing, random source of humanity. This means seeking out others, seeking out nature, or otherwise just embracing the beauty of attention.</p></p>
<p>Alternate conceptions of attention can help us understand its beauty and, more importantly, its ability to connect us with the world around us. Roland Barthes' idea of the *punctum* and Deborah Bird Rose's idea of the *shimmer* both center around how diffuse attention lends itself to interconnectedness. For Barthes, the punctum was an element of an artwork that "pierces" the viewer as their attention wanders around the work, ultimately opening them up into a web of emotions -- both their own and those of the artist who made the work. Rose, on the other hand, describes the shimmer as an inter-generational, animate force underlying nature that opens up a web of organisms harmoniously co-creating with one another. This kind of attention -- decentered, egoless, and genuine presence -- is what Simone Weil called care, and it creates a sense of interconnectedness, whether it be to someone's emotions poured into a work and your resulting reaction or organisms hidden in plain view guiding your somatic attention as you listen for, feel, and smell them.</p>
<p>In practice, my methods and mediums will leverage their unique material and technological properties to further this theme of care within the context of the attention economy as I understand it. Although my mediums will largely be digital, I hope to eventually incorporate purposeful reuse of old, tactile technologies. For now, I want the tools that I make to emphasize software's modularity and malleability to user's desires. Some inspirations of more tactile technologies include Kaloyan Kolev's eink.cam, which combines the thoughtful friction of film with the convenience of a digital camera, as well as Kyung Yun Choi's The Stranger, which uses the materiality of a typewriter to surface how modern technologies depersonalizes communication. Both are very clever, intentional uses of technology that I hope to mimic. </p>
